How to Play
Objective: Match all pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.
Select a game mode (grid size) to start the game.
Click on a card to reveal the emoji.
Click on another card to try and find the matching emoji.
If the two cards match, they remain flipped. If not, they will flip back after a short delay.
Try to complete the game in as few moves and as quickly as possible.
Once all pairs are matched, a congratulatory message will appear showing your time and moves. Play again to beat your score!
